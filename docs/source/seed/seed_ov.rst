Seed-based rs-fMRI Analysis Overview
====================================

* What does this look like?
* Why a seed-based analysis? What can we learn?
* Qualifications- Surface-based (not for subcortical/cerebellar seeds)
* Processing steps- Full-surface correlation
* Prerequisites- Preprocessed rsfMRI run projected to the surface (ideally CBIG2016 preproc output)
* Software requirements for seed-based analysis- CBIG Repo, HCP workbench, Matlab (r2018b preferred)
