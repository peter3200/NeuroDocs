Seed-based Analysis Step 1
==========================

Overview
********

For the first step, we will compute a full-surface functional connectivity matrix. 


Full-Surface Correlation
************************



Average Across Runs
*******************

If your subjects have multiple rs-fMRI runs and you would like to compute a single correlation matrix per subject, we can average across functional connectivity matrices.


Fisher's Z Transformation
*************************

To normalize the Pearson's r correlation values, we can perform the Fisher's Z Transformation.
