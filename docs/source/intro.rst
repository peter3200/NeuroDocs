NeuroDocs are simple tutorials for the beginning neuroimaging researcher and are meant to act as a guide to navigating basic analyses. These (will) range from preprocessing and task-based analysis to resting-state analyses and statistical comparisons. 

Our Goal
********

At a time when transparency and openness are increasing in importance, we are striving to communicate what occurs "behind the scenes" in these analyses, potentially acting as a companion to eventual publications. In brief, our goal is to be informative and transparent.

Limitations
***********

Neuroimaging analyses continue to evolve as new methods and best practices are developed. Thus, it is ultimately up to the reader to explore all of the available options and find the best pipelines and options for their data. Additionally, as amateur coders, we may not have the most efficient or concise code available.
